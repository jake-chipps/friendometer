              <p class="lead">Our team is developing and researching culturally
                responsive curriculum and teacher development that engage American
                Indian and rural Montana students in learning computer science and
                computing skills. Instead of creating a new stand-alone curriculum
                (and new standards for teachers to meet), the project infuses computer
                science across the grades 4-8 curriculum, which helps students
                understand that computing skills are relevant across disciplines
                and are important for a wide variety of professions in the
                work-force. Through a research practice partnership, this project
                is working directly with the Montana Office of Public Instruction,
                tribal entities, teachers, and other stakeholders to develop these
                culturally responsive resources, which will be aligned with the
                new Computer Science state content area standards and with Montana's
                Indian Education for All curriculum.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Broadening Participation</h3>
            <p>Our lessons use physical computing with textiles that are embedded with
              electronics and then programmed by students. Because many teachers and
              students believe that computing is difficult, these novel approaches enable
              more broad access to computer science. They have been shown to not only engage
              students and teachers in rigorous computing, but also to make computing fun.

            <p>We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with
                are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including the A’aninin
                (Gros Ventre), Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway),
                Annishinabe/Métis (Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka
                (Kootenai), Lakota, Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk
                (Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe
                (Northern Cheyenne). Through our work with Montana students and teachers, we honor
                and respect these twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, by drawing
                inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.
