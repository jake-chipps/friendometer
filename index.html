              <p class="lead">Our team is developing and researching culturally
                responsive curriculum and teacher development that engage American
                Indian and rural Montana students in learning computer science and
                computing skills. Instead of creating a new stand-alone curriculum
                (and new standards for teachers to meet), the project infuses computer
                science across the grades 4-8 curriculum, which helps students
                understand that computing skills are relevant across disciplines
                and are important for a wide variety of professions in the
                work-force. Through a research practice partnership, this project
                is working directly with the Montana Office of Public Instruction,
                tribal entities, teachers, and other stakeholders to develop these
                culturally responsive resources, which will be aligned with the
                new Computer Science state content area standards and with Montana's
                Indian Education for All curriculum.</p>
