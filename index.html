              <p class="lead">This curriculum was designed for Montana State
              University Peaks and Potentials summer program. Using an Arduino
              microcontroller, LEDs, and sensors, participants will spend
              five days creating a DIY touch sensor "friend-o-meter." Each
              aspect of design and programming is broken down into sub-parts, where
              module is its own lesson, leading to a functioning computational
              artifact.</p>

            <p>This curriculum can be integrated into any subject matter in formal
              or informal education settings. You just need 750 minutes of
              instructional time.

            <h3 class="text-center">Project Based</h3>
            <p>Each lesson culminates in the construction of a participant-designed
              computational artifact. Bringing together makerspaces, constructionism,
              and narrative-based education, this curriculum grounds learning
              in active, hands-on learning.

            <h3 class="text-center">For Everyone</h3>
            <p>This curiculum is a step-by-step process in creating circuits
              using a microcontroller and developing computational artifacts using
              input and output devices. This is a great place to start if you
              have never worked with computing systems or Arduino before. But
              even those familiar with Arduino may still find value in this project.
              The goal is to be able to create your own projects after completing
              this project.
