## 1 MakeCode <a name="makecode"></a>
[MakeCode](https://makecode.adafruit.com/) is a free, web-based coding platform
that uses drag-and-drop blocks to scaffold learning. Students will create accounts
in MakeCode and can save their projects. Projects can be duplicated, edited,
and shared with others. After coding a project, students can download their code
from MakeCode into the Circuit Playground Express to run on their projects.

### Saving and Sharing Projects <a name="shareproject"></a>
There are no accounts in MakeCode, which means that saved projects are not attached to a student's individual account. But this does not mean that students cannot save and share their projects.

When inside of a project on MakeCode, there is a button in the top left corner of the browser window called "Share." Clicking "Share" will prompt a window that asks the user to name and publish their project. In order to save and share a project for later, a project must first be named and published. Any modifications made to the project after it is published will NOT be reflected in the shared link so if a student makes edits to a project after they have named and shared it, the project must be named and published again and they will get a different link to a new project. This allows us to create versions of projects (if you want students to learn about version control).

<span class="todo">Write instructions to setup the CPX</span>

### Managing Projects <a name="projects"></a>
<span class="todo">Write instructions to create, edit, duplicate, share a project</span>

## 2 Circuits <a name="circuits"></a>
The materials we use to create circuits in this curriculum include:
- **copper tape** as an insulator
- **LEDs** for light patterns
- **Circuit Playground Express** as a power source with computational functionality.

### Tips for Using Copper Tape <a name="copper"></a>
<span class="todo">Write tips and tricks for using the copper tape</span>

### Tips for Using LEDs <a name="led"></a>
<span class="todo">Write some LED "insider knowledge"</span>

## 3 Circuit Playground Express <a name="cpx"></a>
The Circuit Playground Express (CPX) is a programmable microcontroller that is used as an introduction to computing systems. For this curriculum, we will be using the following features built into the CPX:
- 8 alligator-clip friendly input/output **pins**
- 5 mini **NeoPixels**
- 1 sound **sensor**

### Input/Output Pins <a name="pins"></a>
<span class="todo">Explanation of the differences between each of the pins and how we use them</span>

<span class="todo">Explanation of pins we should not use and why (include symbols for warnings)</span>

### NeoPixels <a name="neopixels"></a>
<span class="todo">Explanation of the NeoPixels: locations, colors, brightness</span>

### Sensors <a name="sensors"></a>
<span class="todo">Explanation of the sensors present on the CPX and their referenced pins</span>

### Troubleshooting the CPX <a name="troubleshoot"></a>
<span class="todo">Things that can go wrong and how to fix it</span>
