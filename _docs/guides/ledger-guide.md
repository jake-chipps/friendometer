## 1 Overview <a name="overview"></a>
In section one of the curriculum, students learn about ledger art, and in section
two, students play with circuits. In section three, students combine ledger art
with circuitry as they plan, design, and program ledger art inspired projects.

This guide will present the process of creating the section 3 ledger art project
using an example made by one of the authors of the curriculum. The guide will be
written in the first person to emphasize design choices made by the creator and
how those choices influenced the practice of computing.

## 2 Plan <a name="plan"></a>
First, I brainstormed stories that I wanted to share with others. Growing up
in Los Angeles, my constant environment was a concrete jungle. In 5th grade, my
class took a trip to Yosemite, where we camped and hiked for a week. This experience
changed my world view and my connection with the Earth. I decided to build a
visual narrative to tell the story of my first camping trip in Yosemite.

I [completed the handout](../guides/guide-resources/lap-3-1_telling-stories-with-symbols.pdf)
from [3-1 (Introduce the Ledger Art Project)](../3-1). I chose the following
symbols to help visually tell my story:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| -----: | ------- |
| Backpack | Hiking in the outdoors and feeling a new connection with the land |
| Tent and tree | Sleeping in the outdoors |
| Open circle around me | Feeling a sense of vulnerability |
| Sun with rays | Feeling a sense of wonder and awe |
| Maze | Finding a new sense of self within a new place and experience |
| Earth | Environmentalism; taking care of our home |

I knew that I would need to select three of these images to highlight using
LEDs. I chose the following symbols and explain my reasoning:

| Symbol | Importance to the story |
| -----: | ----------------------- |
| Tent | Sleeping in a tent in the outdoors made me vulnerable and open to my new environment. |
| Maze | Feeling disoriented, I tried to find a new sense of self within this scary and larger place.  |
| Earth | The outcome of this experience is a lifelong dedication to environmentalism and protecting the only home we have.  |

At this point, I was ready to begin designing.

## 3 Design <a name="design"></a>
I cut out a large piece of newspaper and glued it to card stock measuring 8.5" x
11". I then trimmed the excess newspaper to fit the card stock.

I added the symbols that I planned out on top of the newspaper.
