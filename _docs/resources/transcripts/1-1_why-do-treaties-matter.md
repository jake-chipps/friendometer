Native nations signed more than 365 treaties with the United States government
from 1777 to 1871. Even though this happened long ago treaties are living documents
that still matter for both Native and non-Native people and nations today.

A treaty is a formal agreement made between two nations who recognize each
other's right to govern their own people. Treaties affirm a nation's sovereignty.
Treaties are the supreme law of the land.

The United States government's frequent violations of its treaty obligations
do not change that treaties are important for Native Nations. Treaties
guarantee Tribes' ability to access and manage their lands and resources.
Some treaties retain Native People's rights to hunt, fish, and gather as they've
done for thousands of years.

Treaties also affirm Tribal governments rights to maintain a nation-to-nation
relationship with the United States. They outline the United States' ongoing
obligation to provide Native People with access to education and health care.

Ultimately, treaties guarantee the preservation of Native lands and life ways for
future generations. For many Native Nations, the treaty signing process was about
survival. State governments along with the United States government carried out
genocide ethnic cleansing, cultural erasure, and forced removal against Native People.

In an attempt to take their land and other resources, often Native leaders had no
choice but to sign treaties. In order to keep their people alive, they did everything
in their power to protect their Nations while facing insurmountable odds.

Native Nations are still here. Native People continue to thrive as a result of
their ancestors' bravery. Treaty rights are not limited to Native People.
Treaties are the reason why non-Native people have access to land and resources
today. Treaties embody a Nation's integrity.

As citizens, we must hold our governments accountable to meeting and acknowledging
their treaty obligations.
