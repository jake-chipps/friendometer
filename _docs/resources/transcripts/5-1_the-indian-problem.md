By the early 19th century, the US was rapidly growing both in size and power.
Land hungry and ambitious, the new country was also drastically changing
its policies towards the Indian Nations, and nowhere was this more evident than
in the treaties. The United States' primary interest in treaty-making was to acquire
Indian land. And so the treaties were used for that purpose, especially as the
United States found itself in a position to pretty much dictate the terms of the
treaty. And so the treaties morphed from this friendship and reciprocity sort of
relationship into a very one-sided thing.

1:03
There's almost a mythology about this, that somehow when the pilgrims arrived,
they were dragging land behind them. There was no land brought here. The land
here was Native Nations, and this is what the United States needed. It's what it
wanted. They wanted all of them, they wanted everything. The greed came in, "Oh
we have a little tract here now, now we need a little more, and well we need to
go make another treaty." We didn't understand that eventually those treaty
making processes ended up to the acquisition of all of our ancestral homeland.

1:49
That land was a part of us. That land helped us be. That land was who we were and
who we are. The command of removal came unexpectedly upon most of us. There was a
time that we noticed several overloaded wagons were passing our home, and we did
not grasp the meaning. Then one day, wagons stopped. We were to be taken away
and leave our homes, never to return.

2:28
To get what they wanted, US officials brokered treaties through any means available.
Their tactics were so corrupt that the once trusted treaties became quickly known
as bad paper. There were people at these treaty negotiations who would do anything
to get an agreement on the table. And so there was very routinely bribery.
Individual payments made to Tribal leaders alcohol would be used with people in
an agreeable frame of mind, and even coercion to say to people you must sign this
agreement or else. Every means of trickery and fraud was employed against Native
Nations. The United States would appoint a false leadership; people who had no
right to speak for the Tribe, and say, "You're the leader of this Tribe. Sign
this paper giving away all your land."

3:18
As the century progressed, the treaties became more and more lopsided, a far cry
from the parallel paths of the goose winter. Despite appeals from the Indian
Nations, the US kept on its new trajectory, rationalizing its aggressive
actions along the way.

"They have neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire
of improvement. The Tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages."
To leave them in possession of their country was to leave the country a wilderness.
It's important in the great American mythology to describe the Americas as wilderness.
Because if it's wilderness, then there's really nobody to dispossess. It was okay
to come here and prosper and conveniently forget that there were already people and
civilizations in place.

4:25
"At first we had something to eat but that gave out and we were starving. We came
to a slippery elm tree and ate the bark of that. Lots took sick and died." As
Americans successfully pushed the bounds of the frontier they not only believed
that they were destined to take over the land and prosper, they believed that God
was the one who put them there to do it. They believed that it was God's will that
the United States should be a continental nation stretching from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.

5:07
As each wave of immigration would come, they move into an area. The United States
would then make some sort of arrangement with the Tribe to get that land from
them and then more would come, and they'd advance the frontier even further. The
power of manifest destiny, of expansion, of inevitability, God's providence helped
rally people around not only the idea of Americans as entitled to North America
but rallied them around the idea that Indian people were barriers to civilization
and barriers to progress. No matter how many treaties were signed or how much land
they gave to the United States, the Indian was still in the way. This was known
as "the Indian Problem."

5:52
This so-called problem continued despite a decades-old policy to force Indians to
swap their land east of the Mississippi for land west of it. The Indians would
then move to those western parts and away from the Americans. This plan was
simply called "Removal." The Removal Act was the centerpiece of Andrew Jackson's
political agenda and was very controversial at the time. It was very widely
debated. There was lots of discussion across the country and very many prominent
people spoke up against it.

6:24
"Will the American government steal? Will it lie? Will it kill?" I have no desire
to see the poor remnants of a once powerful people. The removal bill represents
oppression with a vengeance." The removal process - it was, "Alright, you've made
these treaties, now you can have one of two things: you can keep your sovereignty
but you can't keep your land; if you keep your land, you have to assimilate and
no longer be Indian. You will have sovereignty or you have your land, you can't
have both across the United States."

7:06
The Removal Act divided the country, but across the Indian Nations, reaction was
unanimous. "We are surrounded by white people and there are encroachments made.
What assurances have we that similar ones will not be made on us should we remove
to the Mississippi? Look here, father, our lands belong to us. We shall keep them.
We do not wish to talk to you anymore. We had already been fighting to keep that
land and sure enough, when the government was coming in there to take us out of
that land, we fought even more. But at some point, you have to realize that this
fighting is all gonna be about death and death is coming. Then I need to be
protecting my family, and I want my children to survive so we have to endure this
removal."

8:01
Many of the Tribes did choose to accept removal as a means of maintaining the Tribal
Nation. What choice was there? After decades of engagement they could no longer
resist and so they gave up their lands, they gave up their homes, they gave up
their fields and forests, they gave up literally their way of life in order to
be able to stay together and be what they were. "We are poor but we are free.
No white man controls our footsteps."

8:52
Some try to assimilate to avoid removal, some were removed completely. But in the
end, every Nation met the same fate. Every Nation had to give up land. "Brothers,
you cannot remain where you are now. You have but one remedy within your reach and
that is to remove to the west. May the Great Spirit teach you how to choose."

9:19
The loss of land was devastating and so was the loss of lives. The most famous of
these incidents was the Cherokee Nation's Trail of Tears. But there were numerous
other trails just as violent. "Injustice crushing, everyone had to walk my baby
brother was four years old. I was just eight but I took my turn at carrying him
because he could not walk much. I would get so tired I think I was going to die,
but I would hang on to him. I was so afraid they would kill him. I saw them kill
babies who were too big to be carried and would give out. That really was a road
of death. People were falling on the side of the road or being shot or being
murdered on the road and being left there."

10:14
The removal process was done in a way that was not efficient in making people
survive. Of the millions of Indian people that lived before the first colonists
arrived, by the end of the 19th century only 250,000 remained. The removal of a
Tribe was certain to destroy all of the things they knew about: taking care of
themselves; all their medicines; all of their foods; everything about them had to
change in order to survive. It can only be understood as an act of destruction.

10:50
"When you move a people from one place to another, when you displace people, when
you wrench people from their homelands, wasn't that genocide? We don't make the
case that there was genocide - we know there was - yet here we are. When we were
forced to leave our land, we took the fires with us, we took the embers along.
Then when we got to Oklahoma, we rekindled, build fire. Old home or new home, it
is the same fire."
