0:16
by the early 19th century the US was

0:19
rapidly growing both in size and power

0:24
land hungry and ambitious the new

0:27
country was also drastically changing

0:29
his policies towards the Indian nations

0:31
and nowhere was this more evident than

0:33
in the trees the United States primary

0:38
interest in treaty making was to acquire

0:41
Indian land and so the treaties were

0:43
used for that purpose especially as the

0:45
United States found itself in a position

0:47
to pretty much dictate the terms of the

0:51
treaty and so the treaties morphed from

0:55
this friendship and reciprocity sort of

0:58
relationship into a very one-sided thing

1:03
there's almost a mythology about this

1:07
that somehow when the pilgrims arrived

1:10
they were dragging land behind them

1:14
there was no land brought here the land

1:18
here was Native Nations and this is what

1:23
the United States needed it's what it

1:26
wanted they wanted all of them they

1:30
wanted everything the greed came in oh

1:35
we have a little tract here now now we

1:37
need a little more and well we need to

1:40
go make another treaty we didn't

1:43
understand that eventually those treaty

1:44
making processes ended up to the

1:46
acquisition of all of our ancestral

1:47
homeland

1:49
that land was a part of us I then helped

1:52
us be that land was who we were and who

1:55
we are the command of removal came

2:00
unexpectedly upon most of us there was a

2:04
time that we noticed several overloaded

2:07
wagons were passing our home that we did

2:10
not grasp the meaning then one day

2:13
wagons stopped we were to be taken away

2:16
and leave our homes never to return to

2:28
get what they wanted

2:29
US officials brokered treaties through

2:31
any means available their tactics were

2:34
so corrupt that the once trusted

2:36
treaties became quickly known as bad

2:38
paper

2:40
there were people at these treaty

2:42
negotiations who would do anything to

2:45
get an agreement on the table and so

2:47
there was very routinely bribery

2:49
individual payments made to tribal

2:51
leaders alcohol would be used with

2:54
people in an agreeable frame of mind and

2:57
even coercion to say to people you must

2:59
sign this agreement or else every means

3:03
of trickery and fraud was employed

3:05
against Native Nations the United States

3:08
would appoint a false leadership people

3:10
who had no right to speak for the tribe

3:13
and say you're the leader of this tribe

3:15
signed this paper giving away all your

3:18
land as the century progressed the

3:22
treaties became more and more lopsided a

3:24
far cry from the parallel paths of the

3:27
goose winter despite appeals from the

3:34
Indian nations the u.s. kept on its new

3:36
trajectory rationalizing its aggressive

3:39
actions along the way

3:43
they have neither the intelligence the

3:46
industry the moral habits nor the desire

3:49
of improvement

3:53
the tribes of Indians inhabiting this

3:56
country were fierce savages to leave

3:58
them in possession of their country was

4:00
to leave the country a wilderness it's

4:05
important in the great American

4:06
mythology to describe the Americas as

4:09
wilderness because of its wilderness

4:11
then there's really nobody to

4:12
dispossessed it was okay to come here

4:15
and prosper and conveniently forget that

4:18
there were already people and

4:19
civilizations in place

4:25
at first we had something to eat

4:28
but that gave out and we were starving

4:31
we came to a slippery elm tree and ate

4:35
the bark of that lots took sick and died

4:43
as Americans successfully pushed the

4:47
bounds of the frontier they not only

4:49
believed that they were destined to take

4:50
over the land and prosper they believed

4:53
that God was the one who put them there

4:54
to do it

4:57
they believe that it was God's will that

5:00
the United States should be a

5:02
continental nation stretching from the

5:05
Atlantic to the Pacific

5:07
as each wave of immigration would come

5:10
they move into an area the United States

5:13
would then make some sort of arrangement

5:15
with the tribe to get that land from

5:18
them and then more would come and they'd

5:20
advance the frontier even further

5:23
the power of manifest destiny of

5:26
expansion of inevitability God's

5:28
providence helped rally people around

5:31
not only the idea of Americans as

5:33
entitled to North America but rallied

5:35
them around the idea that Indian people

5:37
were barriers to civilization and

5:39
barriers to progress no matter how many

5:42
treaties were signed or how much land

5:44
they gave to the United States the

5:46
Indian was still in the way this was

5:49
known as the Indian problem this

5:52
so-called problem continued despite a

5:54
decades-old policy to force Indians to

5:56
swap their land east of the Mississippi

5:58
for land west of it the Indians would

6:02
then move to those western parts and

6:03
away from the Americans this plan was

6:06
simply called removal the Removal Act

6:11
was the centerpiece of Andrew Jackson's

6:14
political agenda and was very

6:16
controversial at the time it was very

6:18
widely debated there was lots of

6:19
discussion across the country and very

6:21
many prominent people spoke up against

6:24
it the American government steel will it

6:28
lie will it kill

6:32
I have no desire to see the poor

6:35
remnants of a once powerful people

6:37
the removal bill represents oppression

6:39
with a vengeance

6:43
the removal process it was alright

6:45
you've made these treaties now you can

6:48
have one of two things you can keep your

6:51
sovereignty but you can't keep your land

6:53
if you keep your land and you have to

6:56
assimilate and no longer be Indian you

6:59
will have sovereignty or you have your

7:01
land you can't have both across the

7:06
United States the Removal Act divided

7:08
the country but across the Indian

7:11
nations reaction was unanimous we are

7:15
surrounded by white people and there are

7:18
encroachments made what assurances have

7:21
we that similar ones will not be made on

7:22
us should we remove to the Mississippi

7:28
look here father our lands belong to us

7:32
we shall keep them we do not wish to

7:35
talk to you anymore

7:40
we had already been fighting to keep

7:42
that land and sure enough when the

7:45
government was coming in there to take

7:47
us out of that land we fought even more

7:49
but at some point you have to realize

7:52
that this fighting is all gonna be about

7:53
death and death is coming

7:57
then I need to be detecting my family

7:59
and I want my children to survive so we

8:01
have to endure this removal many of the

8:06
tribes did choose to accept removal as a

8:09
means of maintaining the tribal nation

8:13
what choice was there

8:17
after decades of engagement they could

8:22
no longer resist

8:26
and so they gave up their lands they

8:28
gave up their homes they gave up their

8:31
fields and forests they gave up

8:33
literally their way of life in order to

8:37
be able to stay together and be what

8:40
they were we are poor but we are free

8:45
no white man controls our footsteps some

8:52
try to assimilate to avoid removal some

8:55
were removed completely but in the end

8:58
every nation met the same fate every

9:02
nation and to give up land brothers you

9:06
cannot remain where you are now you have

9:09
but one remedy within your reach and

9:11
that is to remove to the west may the

9:15
Great Spirit teach you how to choose the

9:19
loss of land was devastating and so was

9:22
the loss of lives the most famous of

9:25
these incidents was the Cherokee

9:27
nation's Trail of Tears but there were

9:30
numerous other trails just as violent

9:32
injustice crushing everyone had to walk

9:36
my baby brother Joel was four years old

9:40
I was just eight but I took my turn at

9:43
carrying him because he could not walk

9:46
much I would get so tired I think I was

9:50
going to die but I would hang on to him

9:53
I was so afraid they would kill him I

9:56
saw them kill babies who were too big to

9:59
be carried and would give out

10:05
that really was a road of death people

10:07
were falling on the side of the road or

10:09
being shot are being murdered on the

10:11
road and being left there the removal

10:14
process was done in a way that was not

10:17
efficient in making people survive of

10:23
the millions of Indian people that lived

10:26
before the first colonists arrived but

10:28
the end of the 19th century only 250,000

10:31
remained the removal of a tribe was

10:35
certain to destroy all of the things

10:37
they knew about taking care of

10:39
themselves all their medicines all of

10:41
their foods everything about them had to

10:43
change in order to survive it can only

10:47
be understood as an act of destruction

10:50
when you move a people from one place to

10:54
another when you displace people when

10:57
you wrench people from their homelands

11:01
wasn't that genocide we don't make the

11:07
case that there was genocide we know

11:12
there was yet here we are when we were

11:20
forced to leave our land we took the

11:22
fires with us we took the embers along

11:26
then when we got to Oklahoma

11:28
we rekindled build fire old home or new

11:33
home it is the same fire
