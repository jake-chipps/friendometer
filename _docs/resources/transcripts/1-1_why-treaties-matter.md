Well I think non-native people know that treaties were signed.

0:05
That might be it.

0:09
A treaty is fundamentally an agreement between two nations.

0:14
Treaties are only made between sovereign governments.

0:18
In fact, the U.S. has made more than 300 treaties with American Indian Nations.

0:23
The United States' existence when it first won the war against Great Britain was very precarious,

0:30
and many countries around the world did not recognize the United States' sovereignty.

0:34
So the U.S., as a way to assert that it was a sovereign,

0:38
it made agreements with Native Nations

0:40
to sort of say to Europe, to Britain, "Hey, we're sovereign too. We can make these agreements."

0:49
The idea that treaties somehow gave status, or standing, or land to indigenous nations

0:55
is probably the main fallacy that exists.

0:58
I think that many people view treaties as “special rights” for Indians.

1:06
They're not rights given to native nations, they're native nations by and large giving rights to the United States.

1:13
I think a lot of people lack an understanding that that wherever they live,

1:17
there's probably a treaty that gives them the right to live there

1:21
granted to them by native nations.

1:25
A nation relinquished its the majority of its land rights, its land holdings, its resource holdings,

1:32
for the right to preserve its way of life.

1:36
The rights that are reserved are more easily defined by the U.S. courts as property rights,

1:43
but better defined by our our traditional and cultural understandings as being

1:49
relationship rights to the land, the water, and all of the beings that we hunt and fish and share that world with.

1:57
It's through treaties that I think we've been able to hold off a lot of forces

2:04
that would like to see us erased from the continent.

2:10
I'm trying to think of one treaty, that from the perspective of the indigenous nation,

2:18
has been fully upheld and implemented.

2:21
Lot of people disregard our treaties and say they're a thing of the past, they've been broken, let's forget about them.

2:28
They've been broken. Let's forget about them. They would like to wipe away the treaty history of the United States,

2:32
but that's simply not how it works.

2:35
Our United States Constitution recognizes that once a treaty is signed and ratified by the Senate

2:40
it becomes the quote "supreme law of the land."

2:43
What that means is, is that a treaty is as much alive as the U.S. Constitution is.

2:50
Are they living documents? Do they exist and they do they transcend generations?

2:54
The answer is absolutely yes.

2:56
When people question the relevance of treaties and say “I don't think treaties are relevant.”

2:59
My responses is, “Then just give us the land back.”

3:03
We're not talking about past history we're talking about today.

3:06
And the best example of that is the Dakota Access Pipeline.

3:11
I think we saw, before the world community, the violation of

3:16
the 1868 and 1851 treaties of the United States with the Lakota Nation in Standing Rock.

3:26
It brought the violation of treaty rights to today.

3:32
Even though tribes have been experiencing those violations time after time after time.

3:40
Treaties go both ways.

3:42
This was a two-way street, that it was a shared, shared history.

3:48
It's about mutual respect.

3:50
Non-native peoples are treaty partners,

3:55
the descendants of the treaty signers, you could say, on the United States side.

4:01
I think that the way that we bring everybody into the conversation is we have

4:06
curriculum that accurately reflects the reality of what an Indian Treaty is.

4:12
That's something we do for the United States Constitution, and the three branches of government.

4:19
Why don't we have a tribal component to that education?

4:25
The ancestors who negotiated the treaties, they were doing their best to protect us

4:32
to protect our culture and to protect our way of life.

4:37
And to me, that's a responsibility and a way in which I should live my life every day

4:43
to remember to honor those ancestors that fought so I could be here today.

4:47
Treaties are living documents because tribes continue to breathe life into them.

4:55
We continue to speak their terms. We continue to remember the promises.
