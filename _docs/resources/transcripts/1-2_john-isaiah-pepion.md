my name is John Pepe and I'm from the
0:01
Blackfoot reservation and the kind of
0:03
heart I do is pictographic plans art and
0:06
bringing it to the forefront more
0:08
contemporary ledger art is a form of art
0:13
amongst plans and then tribes that it's
0:15
over a hundred years old and the period
0:17
that we're currently in is considered
0:19
the contemporary Najjar period every
0:21
piece Rd the designs that and collars
0:23
actually mean something and there's all
0:25
the story behind it like this piece
0:27
right here it's called Native Superman
0:29
and he's doing the Superman trick on his
0:32
bike it's kind of showing like oh we're
0:34
still public culture and how we're still
0:37
dealing with mainstream America and our
0:39
bridging two worlds together like the
0:42
Indian world and the new world that we
0:44
live in with the computers the bytes of
0:46
cell phones so I've been kind of
0:48
bridging that gap with my art being in
0:50
those two worlds together with a little
0:52
bit of humor just like storytelling and
0:55
to me it's sharing and preserving our
0:57
cultural history going into ceremony so
1:01
I sit there and observe I watch the
1:03
movement to everything to design some
1:05
center paying attention and all these
1:06
ideas are going in in my mind and that's
1:08
how I come up with the images I do when
1:10
I do my ledger I'm continuing to find
1:12
out who I am as a person who my family
1:14
is
1:15
especially being Blackfeet in Montana
1:17
and that's what I kind of appreciate but
1:19
I also like to tell the world but who we
1:22
are in our story from our perspective
