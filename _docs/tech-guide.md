## MakeCode
[MakeCode](https://makecode.adafruit.com/) is a free, web-based coding platform
that uses drag-and-drop blocks to scaffold learning. Students will create accounts
in MakeCode and can save their projects. Projects can be duplicated, edited,
and shared with others. After coding a project, students can download their code
from MakeCode into the Circuit Playground Express to make light patterns with
LEDs and use sensors to make decisions.

### Creating a MakeCode Account
<span class="todo">Write instructions to create an account</span>

### Connecting the Circuit PlayGround Express and MakeCode
<span class="todo">Write instructions to setup the CPX</span>

### Managing Projects in MakeCode
<span class="todo">Write instructions to create, edit, duplicate, share a project</span>

## Circuits
The materials we use to create circuits in this curriculum include:
- **copper tape** as an insulator
- **LEDs** for light patterns
- **Circuit Playground Express** as a power source with computational functionality.

### Copper Tape
<span class="todo">Write tips and tricks for using the copper tape</span>

### LEDs
<span class="todo">Write some LED "insider knowledge"</span>

## Circuit Playground Express
The Circuit Playground Express (CPX) is a programmable microcontroller that is used as an introduction to computing systems. For this curriculum, we will be using the following features built into the CPX:
- 8 alligator-clip friendly input/output **pins**
- 5 mini **NeoPixels**
- 1 sound **sensor**

### Pins
<span class="todo">Explanation of the differences between each of the pins and how we use them</span>

<span class="todo">Explanation of pins we should not use and why (include symbols for warnings)</span>

### NeoPixels
<span class="todo">Explanation of the NeoPixels: locations, colors, brightness</span>

### Sensors
<span class="todo">Explanation of the sensors present on the CPX and their referenced pins</span>

### Troubleshooting the CPX
<span class="todo">Things that can go wrong and how to fix it</span>
