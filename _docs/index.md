## Overview

This curriculum is an introduction to programming physical computational artifacts. 

### 1 Circuits
- Design and create simple, parallel, and computational circuits.
- Code sequential light patterns using functions.

### 2 Design
- Design and construct a computational artifact.
- Use a sensor to collect data from diverse users and develop models.

### 3 Control Structures
- Use conditionals to implement decision-making in code.
- Use loops to iterate through NeoPixel values.
- Use RGB values creatively to represent computational data.

### 4 Data Structures
- Add reset functionality using conditionals and digital sensors.
- Use arrays to store and iterate through sound frequencies and delays to create music.

### 5 Inclusive Design
- Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of technologies.
