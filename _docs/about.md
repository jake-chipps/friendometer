## Land Acknowledgement
We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with
are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including the A’aninin
(Gros Ventre), Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway),
Annishinabe/Métis (Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka
(Kootenai), Lakota, Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk
(Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe
(Northern Cheyenne). Through our work with Montana students and teachers, we honor
and respect these twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, by drawing
inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.
