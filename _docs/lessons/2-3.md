## Sensors

```
int touchSensor = A10; //name your aluminum foil patch

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); //allows you to print to the Serial Monitor
  pinMode(touchSensor, INPUT); //sets the aluminum foil patch to input
  digitalWrite(touchSensor, HIGH); //initializes the aluminum foil patch
}

void loop() {
  int touchVal = analogRead(touchSensor); //reads the current value of the aluminum foil and
                                          //stores the value in a new variable
  delay(100); //waits 1/10 of a second
  Serial.println(touchVal); //prints the sensor value to the Serial Monitor
}
```

Storage vs sensor var
Write to Serial
