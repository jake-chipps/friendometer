## Overview
Every design decision has the potential to include or exclude users. In this section, we will reflect on the decisions we made as we developed the *Friend-O-Meter* and consider the needs of diverse users.

## Human-Computer Interaction
When designing ways that humans interact with computers and vice versa, it is important to consider how our designs might harm or exclude users. Consider the hardware and software of the *Friend-O-Meter* and the decisions that you as a programmer made during development.

- In what ways might users not be able to access the functionality of your *Friend-O-Meter*?
  - What hardware do they need to be able to use it? Are there barriers in terms of hardware?
  - How do users interface with it? Are there barriers in terms of interface?
  - What values from the touch sensor did you use for your three functions? Are there barriers in terms of computational decisions that might impact users?
- In what ways might the *Friend-O-Meter* harm relationships?
- In what ways might the *Friend-O-Meter* be physically dangerous for users?
