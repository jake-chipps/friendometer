IEFA, Social Studies

## Grade Level
4/5    

## Established Goal(s)/Target(s)
-	Students will be able to describe how Tribes in Montana were affected by relocation and assimilation policies.

## Montana Standards
- <u>IEFA Essential Understanding #4</u> Though there have been tribal peoples living successfully on the North American lands for millennia, reservations are lands that have been reserved by or for tribes for their exclusive use as permanent homelands. Some were created through treaties, while others were created by statutes and executive orders. The principle that land should be acquired from tribes only through their consent with treaties involved three assumptions: I. Both parties to treaties were sovereign powers; II. Indian tribes had some form of transferable title to the land; III. Acquisition of Indian lands was solely a government matter not to be left to individual colonists or states.

- <u>IEFA Essential Understanding #5</u> There were many federal policies put into place throughout American history that have affected Indian people and continue to shape who they are today. Many of these policies conflicted with one another. Much of Indian history can be related through several major federal policy periods:
  - Colonization/Colonial Period, 1492-1800s
  - Treaty-Making and Removal Period, 1778-1871
  - Reservation Period – Allotment and Assimilation, 1887-1934
  - Tribal Reorganization Period, 1934-1953 	
  - Termination and Relocation Period, 1953-19
- <u>SS.H.4.2</u> identify events and policies that have impacted and been influenced by tribes in Montana
- <u>RI.4.1</u> refer to details and examples in a text when explaining what the texts says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text
- <u>SL.4.1</u> engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 4 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly
- <u>SS.H.5.3</u> identify roles of individuals and groups and their impacts on United States and tribal historical events
- <u>RI.5.4</u> determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 5 topic or subject area.
- <u>SL.5.1</u> engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 5 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.

## Evidence of Learning
- Students can discuss how Tribes in Montana were affected by relocation and assimilation policies.

## Prep
Teachers should complete the following preparation for the lesson:

- Prepare [The “Indian Problem” \| SmithsonianNMAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if-BOZgWZPE) for student viewing. ([Transcript](../resources/transcripts/5-1_the-indian-problem.md))
- Create student groups (four students/group).
- Prepare blank poster paper for student groups.
- Have sticky notes ready.
- Make copies of [Treaties and Policies Fact Sheets](../resources/5-1_treaties-and-policies-fact-sheets.pdf) handout (1 fact sheet per group).
  - There are four fact sheets; distribute only one fact sheet to each group.

## Vocabulary
The following are terms used in this lesson.

Term | Definition
-- | --
**Termination**  |  The House Concurrent Resolution 108 of 1953 established policy for ending the nation-to-nation relationship between the United States government and Tribes. The goal was to assimilate individual American Indians into European American ways of life by granting them all the rights of U.S. citizenship. However, the policy caused a lot of challenges for American Indians, which are still felt to this day even though the termination policy was ended legally in 1970.
**Native American/American Indian/Indigenous**  |  terms to refer to groups of people who claim the earliest connection to land in the United States. These people lived in the United States before the United States existed and have maintained distinct cultures and ways of life. American Indian Tribes have status as independent (sovereign) Nations within the United States.
**Treaty**  |  an agreement made by negotiation; a contract in writing between two or more political authorities formally signed by representatives authorized to do so.
**Forced Relocation**  |  migration of people from one place to another, as ordered by the government.
**Assimilation**  |  the absorption of an individual or minority group of people into another society or group.
**Mainstream**  |  what most people in a society think is normal. American Indians and European Americans had different ideas about what was mainstream.
**Sovereignty**  |  ensures self-government, cultural preservation, and peoples’ control over their future; affirms the political identity of Indian Nations.
**Reservation**  |  land reserved by a Tribe for their own use, through a treaty, and was not “given" to them.

## Lesson Guide

### Relocation (25 mins)
Present the map of the US from [1-1](../1-1.md).

![reservations map](../resources/images/1-1_map.png)

Tell students that we learned about what reservations are and how they were developed through treaties between sovereign Tribal Nations and the US Government. But stories are important, and we will now learn the story of how Tribes were relocated from their land to those reservations.

Pass out sticky notes. Before showing the next video, invite students to write any questions they may have on a sticky note. Inform students that after the video, they will put the note on the board in the front of the room.

Play [The “Indian Problem” \| SmithsonianNMAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if-BOZgWZPE)

Give students time to place their sticky notes on the board. Read sticky notes.

Clarify any misconceptions or questions that students might have. Particularly focus on the concepts below.
Removal/Assimilation
```
Students should understand that in the early 1800s and 1900s the United States
took land fromAmerican Indians for European Americans to settle on.  The Indian
Removal Act of 1830 allowed the US government to force American Indians off their
lands to establish American settlements. Treaties designated parcels of land,
called reservations, specifically for the American Indians to live on and keep
their sovereignty. In exchange, the United States government falsely promised
to provide housing, health care, education, and other services. The US government
made great efforts to assimilate American Indians into mainstream American culture
for the purpose of gaining land for European settlers. This was problematic for
American Indians who lost their cultures and languages. American Indian boarding
schools were established, and Native children were required to attend. These
schools were very strict and Native children were forced to speak English and
lose their language and culture.
```
Termination/Relocation
```
Students should understand that in the early 1950s the federal government initiated
the Relocation and Termination Policies. The intent of these policies was, once
again, to bring American Indians into the American mainstream. The Relocation
Policy encouraged, through job training programs, the movement of reservation
Indians to major urban areas like Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver and Dallas. The
Termination Policy’s intent was to terminate the nation-to-nation relationship
between Tribes and the federal government. It resulted in withdrawal of federal
support, guaranteed through the treaty process. Responsibility for Tribes was
transferred to the states in which the Tribes were located. In all, termination
was imposed on about 12 tribes and bands before lawmakers were convinced by Tribes
and their allies to abandon the policy altogether. During this time period,
American Indians and their position as sovereign nations was close to removal
altogether (pp.110-111, IEFA, Connecting Cultures & Classrooms).
```
Invite students to write one thing they learned, found most interesting, or found most surprising on a sticky note and place on another part of the room. Read sticky notes.

### Treaties and Policies (15 mins)
Divide the class into groups of four and assign each group one of the following four treaties/policies from the [Treaties and Policies Fact Sheets](../resources/5-1_treaties-and-policies-fact-sheets.pdf) handout:
- Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851
- Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868
- Dawes Act (General Allotment Act of 1887)
- Termination Act

Give each group the fact page for their assigned treaty/policy. Students will read through the fact sheet and summarize the treaty/policy in one sentence.

On the board, write what students will put on their poster:
```
identify why it matters and  
describe how it impacted the Tribes of Montana.
```
Provide students with a piece of poster paper.  

Students will create a poster about the policies and treaties that affected American Indians.

### Museum Walk (10 mins)
One person (museum guide) from each group will stand at their poster. Each group (three students now) will walk to the posters for the other treaties when the teacher gives the signal. The museum guide will explain the poster and continue until each group has seen the other treaties.
