## Overview
The current investigation is how can we add more than one LED to a circuit. In
[Parallel Circuits](../1-2/), we learned that if we connect multiple LEDs by
simply continuing the positive and negative lines, then those LEDs would all be
connected to the same output pin on the Circuit Playground. This means that if we
turn on the pin, all the LEDs turn on.

**What if we want to control multiple LEDs separately?**

If we want to control multiple LEDs separately, we need to connect the positive
poles of our LEDs to different pins.

## Circuit Diagram
<span class="important">Before continuing, make sure you unplug your Circuit Playground from your
computer. Whenever working on the circuit, make sure your project is not connected
to power.</span>

In order to add a third LED to our project, we are going to connect the positive
pole of the new LED to a new pin on the Circuit Playground. You have two options
for the ground on the new LED:
1. Connect the new LED's negative pole to the ground that already exists
2. Add a new line for the new LED's negative pole and connect it to a different GND on the Circuit Playground.

Current flows from the positive pole of the power source (the output pins) to the
load. Current returns to the power source via ground; it doesn't matter how it gets
there.

For example, in our example, we drew a circuit diagram for a computational circuit
where the ground on the new LED connects to the ground that was previously created.

We then added copper tape and an LED to the circuit diagram.

### Do It Yourself
1. Draw a third LED to your circuit diagram that can be independently controlled.
2. Add copper tape and an LED as designed.
3. Modify your code by creating a new variable for the new pin, set the pin as an output, and turn the pin on.
