## Overview
The current investigation is how can we add more than one LED to a circuit. In
[Parallel Circuits](../1-2/), we learned that if we connect multiple LEDs by
simply continuing the positive and negative lines, then those LEDs would all be
connected to the same output pin on the Circuit Playground. This means that if we
turn on the pin, all the LEDs turn on.

**What if we want to control multiple LEDs separately?**

If we want to control multiple LEDs separately, we need to connect the positive
poles of our LEDs to different pins.
