## Frequency
A note is a sound that is defined by a certain pitch. In Western music, we use 12 semitones on a chromatic scale. If you were to look at a piano, each piano key is a different note. The white keys are the notes **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G**, **A**, **B**, and the black keys are sharps # (a half tone above the white key to the left) and flats b (a half tone below the white key to the right). Groups of notes from C to B are defined as an octave. A C in octave 3 is lower than a C in octave 4 which is lower than a C in octave 5.
