## Overview

## Buzzer

## Frequency and Duration
A note is a sound that is defined by a certain pitch (**frequency**), and we play the note for a certain time interval (**duration**).

### Frequency
In Western music, we use 12 semitones on a chromatic scale. If you were to look at a piano, each piano key is a different note. The white keys are the notes **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G**, **A**, **B**, and the black keys are sharps **#** (a half tone above the white key to the left) and flats **b** (a half tone below the white key to the right). Groups of notes from C to B are defined as an octave. A C in octave 3 is lower than a C in octave 4 which is lower than a C in octave 5.

All Western music uses these notes in some combination. So how do we turn these notes into code that can be used to play the note on the buzzer? Like colored light, where different frequencies produce different colors, different frequencies of sound produce different notes. Below you will find the frequency values (in Hertz) for all the notes in octave 3 through octave 5. We are using these three octaves because anything beyond those octaves will not register on the small buzzer.

Note | Octave 3 | Octave 4 | Octave 5 |
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
**C**  |  130.81 | 261.63  | 523.25
**C#/Db**  | 138.59  | 277.18  |  554.37  
**D**  | 146.83  | 293.66  |  587.33
**D#/Eb**  | 155.56  | 311.13  | 622.25   
**E**  | 164.81  | 329.63  |  659.25
**F**  | 174.61  | 349.23  | 698.46  
**F#/Gb**  | 185  | 369.99  | 739.99   
**G**  | 196  | 392  | 783.99  
**G#/Ab**  | 207.65  | 415.3  | 830.61  
**A**  | 220  | 440  | 880  
**A#/Bb**  | 233.08  | 466.16  |  932.33  
**B**  | 246.94  | 493.88  |  987.77

### Duration
In sheet music, we have symbols that represent how long to play each note. We represent note lengths in terms of **whole**, **half**, **quarter**, and **eighth** notes.

A whole note is sustained for the longest amount of time. There are two half notes for every whole note. There are two quarter notes for every half note, and there are 2 eighth notes for every quarter note. In other words, if a whole note is worth 800 milliseconds, then a half note would be 400 milliseconds, a quarter note would be 200 milliseconds, and an eighth note would be 100 milliseconds.

For example, if we wanted to play The Alphabet Song, stopping at P, then the list of notes with their durations might look like this:

**Note** | C | C | G | G | A | A | G
**Duration** | quarter | quarter | quarter | quarter | quarter | quarter | half

**Note** | F | F | E | E | D | D | D | D | C
**Duration** |  quarter | quarter | quarter | quarter | eighth | eighth | eighth | eighth | half

**Task** Use the [virtual piano](https://www.musicca.com/piano) to create a fun sequence of notes, where each note as a given duration (whole, half, quarter, eighth). If you can read music and would like to convert a melody from sheet music, go for it!
Use the table below to write down each note in order and for how long it will play.

**Note** | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
**Duration** | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
