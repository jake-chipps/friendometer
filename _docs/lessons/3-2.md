## Overview
Now that we have three functions that will run based on three conditions for the touch sensor, let's do something other than just print out whichever category was invoked. We will use **NeoPixels** on the Circuit Playground to give the users a spectacular visualization of their friendship. Unlike the LEDs we attached to our projects with copper tape, we can program the NeoPixels to change any color on the color wheel. So before we start coding the NeoPixels, we need to understand how colors work with light.

## Pixel Color Values
Colored light works a little differently than colored paint. When you mix a lot of paint together, the color gets darker and murkier. But when you add more light, color gets brighter and lighter.

All the colors on the color wheel can be made using an additive mixture of red, green, and blue. For short, we call this mixture **RGB**. Each **color channel** (red, green, blue) has a value from *0* (no color) to *255* (full color).

Here are a sample of colors with their mixed values:

Color | Red | Green | Blue
----: | --- | ----- | ----
<span style="color:red">Red</span>  | 255  | 0  | 0
<span style="color:green">Green</span>  | 0  | 255  | 0
<span style="color:blue">Blue</span>  | 0  | 0  | 255
<span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span>  |  0 | 255  |  255
<span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span>  | 255  | 0  |  255
<span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span>  | 255  | 255  |  0
<span style="color:brown">Brown</span>  | 165  | 42  |  42
<span style="color:aquamarine">Aquamarine</span>  | 127  | 255  |  212
