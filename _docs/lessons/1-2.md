## Overview
Now that we have a single LED that turns on, the next question is... *how can we add more LEDS*?
If we want to add another LED to our simple circuit, there are two ways that we
can do this:
1. Add the new LED to the same output pin we used in the simple circuit.
2. Connect the new LED to a different output pin.

Each of these options have advantages and disadvantages. We will explore (1)
in this section (Parallel Circuits) and (2) in the next section (Computational Circuits).
