## Overview
Now that we have a single LED that turns on, the next question is... *how can we add more LEDS*?
If we want to add another LED to our simple circuit, there are two ways that we
can do this:
1. Add the new LED to the same output pin we used in the simple circuit.
2. Connect the new LED to a different output pin.

Each of these options have advantages and disadvantages. We will explore (1)
in this section (Parallel Circuits) and (2) in the next section ([Computational Circuits](../1-3/)).

## Circuit Diagram
Before continuing, make sure you unplug your Circuit Playground from your
computer. Whenever working on the circuit, make sure your project is not connected
to power.

In order to add a second LED to the simple circuit, we can continue the positive
line to the positive pole of the new LED and the ground to the negative pole of the
new LED. That's it! Here is an example from the one we worked on.
