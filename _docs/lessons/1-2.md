## Overview
Now that we have a single LED that turns on, the next question is... *how can we add more LEDS*?
If we want to add another LED to our simple circuit, there are two ways that we
can do this:
1. Add the new LED to the same output pin we used in the simple circuit.
2. Connect the new LED to a different output pin.

Each of these options have advantages and disadvantages. We will explore (1)
in this section (Parallel Circuits) and (2) in the next section ([Computational Circuits](../1-3/)).

## Circuit Diagram
Before continuing, make sure you unplug your Circuit Playground from your
computer. Whenever working on the circuit, make sure your project is not connected
to power.

In order to add a second LED to the simple circuit, we can continue the positive
line to the positive pole of the new LED and the ground to the negative pole of the
new LED. That's it! Here is an example from the one we worked on.

Using red for your positive line and blue for your negative line, map out where
you want your second LED to be located and draw lines from your current LED to
the new one. Make sure you label your components with + and - so you can easily
read your drawing later if necessary.

## Construct the Parallel Circuit
Add the LED with the poles going the direction indicated on your circuit diagram,
and add copper tape from your first LED to your second. Make sure the new copper
tape is strongly connected to your previous LED. If there are gaps in either your
positive side or negative side, the LED will not turn on.

Once done, plug your project into your computer. If the starter code is no longer
downloaded on your Circuit Playground, copy and paste the following into Arduino:

```
int myLED = 10;

void setup() {
  pinMode(myLED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(myLED, HIGH);
}
```

Change the pin number to the one you used, compile the code by pressing the check mark
and download it into the microcontroller.

Both LEDs should light up! <span class="think">How is one pin turning on both
of the LEDs? Try to think about what the code is doing to the pin and what
is happening at a physical level to turn both LEDs on using a single pin.</span>
