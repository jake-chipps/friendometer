|   |   |

## Established Goal(s)/Target(s)
-	Students will understand and discuss the need for American Indian methods of nonverbal communication.

## Content Standards
- **IEFA Essential Understandings**
  - *EU 1 (Tribal Diversity)* There is great diversity among the twelve sovereign tribes of Montana in their languages, cultures, histories, and governments. Each tribe has a distinct and unique cultural heritage that contributes to modern Montana.
  - *EU 2 (Individual Diversity)* Just as there is great diversity among tribal nations, there is great diversity among individual American Indians as identity is developed, defined, and redefined by entities, organizations, and people. There is no generic American Indian.
- **Other Content Standards**
  - *SS.G.4.2* identify and label the tribes in Montana and their indigenous territories, and current locations.
  - *SS.G.5.2* create, organize, and present geographic information to show settlement patterns in the United States, including impacts on tribal lands.
  - *SS.H.4.2* identify events and policies that have impacted and been influenced by tribes in Montana.
  - *SL.4.1* engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 4 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.
  - *W.4.10* write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, revision) and shorter time frames (a single setting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes and audiences.
  - *RI.5.4* determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 5 topic or subject area.
  - *SL.5.1* engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 5 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.
  - *W.5.10* write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences.

## Lesson Guide

### Talking Without Words (40 mins)
Pass out [Talking Without Words](../resources/4-3_talking-without-words.pdf) handout. Tell students that they will watch a video about American Indian communication. Tell students that the video will be broken up into two sections and will discuss non-verbal communication. Explain that **non-verbal communication** is a way to talk to others without using written or spoken words. For example, sign language is non-verbal communication.

Invite students to read and answer questions 1-3 on the handout.

Play [Talking Without Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZU6Lh1IQg) for the class. Stop the video at 2:55.

Invite students to respond to number 4.

Class Discussion
```
How did different Tribal people communicate with each other in the past when they
did not know each otherâ€™s languages?  
```
Play [Talking Without Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZU6Lh1IQg) from 2:55 to 9:30.

Give time for students to write responses to 5-7.

Class Discussion
```
What are some different ways in which sign language was used as a form of direct
communication?  

The Tribal educators in the film discuss contemporary efforts to revitalize and
preserve sign language.  

Why do you suppose this preservation is important to tribal cultures?  

What does sign language express about individual tribes and their cultures?
```

### Reflection (10 mins)
All students stand in a circle. The teacher asks the students to come up with a way to express the following using non-verbal communication (the communication can be as long or short as students want), and students share their communication one by one:
```
How is your encryption project related to Montana Tribal non-verbal communication?
```
