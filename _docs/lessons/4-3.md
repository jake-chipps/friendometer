## Lesson Guide

### Talking Without Words (40 mins)
Pass out [Talking Without Words](../resources/4-3_talking-without-words.pdf) handout. Tell students that they will watch a video about American Indian communication. Tell students that the video will be broken up into two sections and will discuss non-verbal communication. Explain that **non-verbal communication** is a way to talk to others without using written or spoken words. For example, sign language is non-verbal communication.

Invite students to read and answer questions 1-3 on the handout.

Play [Talking Without Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZU6Lh1IQg) for the class. Stop the video at 2:55.

Invite students to respond to number 4.

Class Discussion
```
How did different Tribal people communicate with each other in the past when they
did not know each otherâ€™s languages?  
```
Play [Talking Without Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZU6Lh1IQg) from 2:55 to 9:30.

Give time for students to write responses to 5-7.

Class Discussion
```
What are some different ways in which sign language was used as a form of direct
communication?  

The Tribal educators in the film discuss contemporary efforts to revitalize and
preserve sign language.

What does sign language express about individual tribes and their cultures?
```
