## Overview
In this section, we will use our new understanding of the touch sensors to create three distinct conditions:
- If the sensor value is high, the friendship level is low,
- If the sensor value is moderate, the friendship level is medium,
- If the sensor value is low, the friendshiplevel is high.

We will then use the NeoPixels to create a visual representation of each of these conditions.

This section builds on understanding gained from [Circuits](../1-0/) and [Design the Friend-O-Meter](../2-0/).
