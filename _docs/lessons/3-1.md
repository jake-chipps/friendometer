## Overview
In this section, we will use our new understanding of the touch sensors to create three distinct conditions:
- If the sensor value is high, the friendship level is low,
- If the sensor value is moderate, the friendship level is medium,
- If the sensor value is low, the friendship level is high.

We will then use the NeoPixels to create a visual representation of each of these conditions.

This section builds on understanding gained from [Circuits](../1-0/) and [Design the Friend-O-Meter](../2-0/).

## Conditionals
Based on the value of the sensor, we want our code to decide between three different options:
1. If the sensor value is **high**, do **A**.
2. If the sensor value is **medium**, do **B**.
3. If the sensor value is **low**, do **C**.

To create this type of decision-making in code, we use **conditionals**. A conditional statement begins with the word *if*, just like our three conditions above. After the if, there is a condition. The condition either has a value of **true** or **false**. A statement that is either true or false is called a **Boolean statement**. When we write a conditional in code, it looks like this:

```
if( <Boolean statement> ) {
  //run some code
}
```

If the *Boolean statement* is true, the code will run. Otherwise, everthing inside the brackets will be skipped and the code will continue. We will need to decide what it means for the sensor value to be "high", "medium", and "low". But for example, if we decide that the sensor value is high if it is above 900, then we would write:

```
if(sensorVal > 900) {
  //do A
}
```

In order to further understand how to write conditionals, we need to learn more about Boolean statements and compound Boolean statements.
