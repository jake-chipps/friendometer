## Overview
In this section, we will use our new understanding of the touch sensors to create three distinct conditions:
- If the sensor value is high, the friendship level is low,
- If the sensor value is moderate, the friendship level is medium,
- If the sensor value is low, the friendship level is high.

We will then use the NeoPixels to create a visual representation of each of these conditions.

This section builds on understanding gained from [Circuits](../1-0/) and [Design the Friend-O-Meter](../2-0/).

## Conditionals
Based on the value of the sensor, we want our code to decide between three different options:
1. If the sensor value is **high**, do **A**.
2. If the sensor value is **medium**, do **B**.
3. If the sensor value is **low**, do **C**.

To create this type of decision-making in code, we use **conditionals**. A conditional statement begins with the word *if*, just like our three conditions above. After the if, there is a condition. The condition either has a value of **true** or **false**. A statement that is either true or false is called a **Boolean statement**. When we write a conditional in code, it looks like this:

```
if( <Boolean statement> ) {
  //run some code
}
```

If the *Boolean statement* is true, the code will run. Otherwise, everthing inside the brackets will be skipped and the code will continue. We will need to decide what it means for the sensor value to be "high", "medium", and "low". But for example, if we decide that the sensor value is high if it is above 900, then we would write:

```
if(sensorVal > 900) {
  //do A
}
```

In order to further understand how to write conditionals, we need to learn more about Boolean statements and compound Boolean statements.

### Booleans
A **Boolean statement** is a statement that is either **true** or **false**. We use Boolean statements often in mathematics. For example, *X=8* will be true if *X* is *8* and will be false if *X* is anything else. *X > 10* will be true if *X* is *20* and false if *X* is *4*.

We will need some comparison operations before moving forward. Here is a list of comparison operations with examples:

Operator | What We Say | Example | Description
-------: | :---------- | :------ | :----------
== | EQUAL TO | sensorVal == 900 | Returns true if sensorVal is equal to 900 and false otherwise.
!=  | NOT EQUAL TO  | sensorVal != 900  | Returns true if sensorVal is not equal to 900 and false otherwise.
\>  | GREATER THAN  | sensorVal > 900  | Returns true if sensorVal is greater than 900 and false otherwise.
\>=  | GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO  | sensorVal >= 900  |  Returns true if sensorVal is greater than or equal to 900 and false otherwise.
\<  | LESS THAN  | sensorVal < 900  | Returns true if sensorVal is less than 900 and false otherwise.
\<=  | LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO  | sensorVal <= 900  |  Returns true if sensorVal is greater than 900 and false otherwise.

We can perform operations on Booleans.

Symbol | What We Say | Example | Description
-----: | :---------- | :------ | :----------
!  | NOT  | !(sensorVal == 900) | Logically equivalent to sensorVal != 900. The NOT operator turns TRUE to FALSE and FALSE to TRUE.
&&  | AND   | sensorVal < 900 && sensorVal > 700  | Returns true if sensorVal is between 700 and 900 and false otherwise.
\|\|  | OR  | sensorVal > 900 \|\| sensorVal < 700  |  Returns true if sensorVal is greater than 900 or less than 700 and false otherwise.

Here is a list of the values that come from Boolean operators as a reference. Here, we are using variables P and Q to denote Boolean statements.

P | Q | !P | !Q | P && Q | P \|\| Q
T | T | F | F | T | T
T  | F  | F  | T  | F  | T
F  | T  | T  | F  | F  | T
F  | F  | T  | T  | F  | F
