##Overview
Now that you have a circuit diagram, it is time to add the sensor patches and LEDs
and connect the circuit using the copper tape.

## Craft

### Touch Sensors
1. Cut the aluminum foil into whatever shape you want for your touch patches. Glue the foil firmly to the card stock.

2. Add copper tape across the patches and continue the lines from your circuit diagram.

### LEDs
1. Connect the positive line of each LED to secure the LED to the paper.
2. Connect the ground line of your LEDs.

## Code
Test your LEDs.
1. Create a descriptively named variable for each output pin you use.
2. In the *setup* function, use the *pinMode* function to set each declared pin as an *OUTPUT*.
3. In the *loop* function, call *digitalWrite* to set each pin to *HIGH*.
4. Download the code into the Circuit Playground.

If your lights do not turn on, first check your physical connections. Then check your code.
