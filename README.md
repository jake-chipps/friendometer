# Getting Started
To edit the lessons in this curriculum, go to the [lessons folder](./_docs/lessons/). To preview changes, [go to the rendered preview website](https://montanastorytelling.github.io/ledger-art/) (changes may take up to a minute; you may need to refresh). It is recommended that you have both open in separate tabs. In order for your edits to appear on the site, you need to commit and push changes. For ease of use, do not create branches; using the main branch is sufficient.

For information on member comments, TODOs, and all standards of practice, visit the page for Guidelines for [Using GitHub Pages for Curriculum Development](https://github.com/montanastorytelling/wiki/blob/main/github-pages.md).
